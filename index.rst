Open Civic Data
===============

Welcome
===============

Welcome to the `Open Civic Data Project <https://github.com/opencivicdata/>`_, your home to accessing tools making it easier for governments to share data and for people to engage with their governments.  Our API's are customized yet generic enough that they are able to transcend all levels and nationalities of government for displaying readible and accessible data on:

*People - by identifying people correctly we allow for accuracy of datasets and allows civic activists and technologists, as well as government officials, to scale up their transparency without a large increase in resources.
*Organizations - by reliably identifying organizations and the people who hold roles within them helps categorize other types of information so that it's easy (and possible) to find information that is relevant to you.
*Events -  by making local events more accessible to learn about, government is able to reach their intended audience which makes citizens more likely to discover and attend events that are relevant to them. 
*Bills - by making legislative documents available online and accessible to everyone makes exchanges between representatives and citizens more informed and fruitful, in addition to being core to a transparent and accountable government.

Aspects of Open Civic Data Project
===============

1. _Constraints allow widespread use_ - specifications of how we can store legsilative data in an organized and machine readible way allows you to use this tool uniquely and customizable to the government entity you need to express.
2. *API's* - with the general scaffolding we have provided a general framework has been created, saving the dread of duplicative work and opens the space for collaboration

Why Open Civic Data is Important
===============
In addition to providing guidance on publishing elements on people, organizations, events and bill, Open Civic Data will collect any information made available in this format into a common database that *anyone can access*. This will facilitate the reuse of this information across different jurisdictions and organizations. 


If you're looking to contribute to the project or learn how to use the data, you're in the right place.
